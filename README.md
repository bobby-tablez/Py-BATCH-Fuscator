# Py-BATCH-Fuscator
A set of Python scripts that use a known method of batch script obfuscation by messing with the encoding. Simply pass in the file name ending in either .cmd or .bat as a parameter. 

To encode:
`python pbf-obfuscate.py myfile.cmd`

To decode:
`python pbf-deobfuscate.py test_obfuscated.cmd`
