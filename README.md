# Py-BATCH-Fuscator
A set of Python scripts that use a known method of batch script obfuscation by messing with the encoding. Simply pass in the file name ending in either .cmd or .bat as a parameter. 

Usage: `python pbf.py -h`

To encode:
`python pbf.py -e myfile.cmd`

To decode:
`python pbf.py -d test_obfuscated.cmd`
